# Tabular Data Analysis: Airbnb Dataset

## Overview
This project involves tabular data analysis and modeling using the **Airbnb Dataset**. The primary objective was to analyze and preprocess the data, perform clustering and anomaly detection, and build a classification model to predict pricing categories.

## Steps Performed
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized missing values and correlations.
   - Generated summary statistics and pairwise relationships.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values.
   - Performed feature encoding using label encoding.
   - Applied normalization and removed low-variance features.

3. **Clustering and Anomaly Detection**:
   - Implemented **KMeans Clustering** for grouping data.
   - Applied **Isolation Forest** for anomaly detection.

4. **Modeling**:
   - Built a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict pricing categories.
   - Evaluated the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Outputs
1. **Processed Dataset**:
   - The Airbnb dataset was too large for GitHub, so it was not included in this repository. Instead, a Kaggle link is provided below.

2. **Model**:
   - The trained model (`airbnb_rf_model.pkl`) was too large to be included in this repository.
