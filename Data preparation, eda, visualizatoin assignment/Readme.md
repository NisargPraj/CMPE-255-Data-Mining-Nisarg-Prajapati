# Data preparation, eda, visualization assignment

This repository contains the implementation of two major components of data analysis and modeling:

1. **Time Series Forecasting**:
   - Performed forecasting using the **Seattle Weather Dataset**.
   - Applied exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing.
   - Built and evaluated **ARIMA** and **Prophet** models for forecasting precipitation trends.

2. **Tabular Data Analysis**:
   - Conducted analysis and modeling on the **Airbnb Dataset**.
   - Preprocessed the data, handled missing values, performed feature encoding, and applied clustering and anomaly detection.
   - Built a classification model to predict pricing categories.

Both components include detailed preprocessing, modeling, and analysis workflows, along with generated processed datasets.
