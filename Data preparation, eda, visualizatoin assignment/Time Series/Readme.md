# Time Series Forecasting: Seattle Weather Dataset

## Overview
This project involves time series forecasting using the **Seattle Weather Dataset**. The goal was to forecast precipitation trends using advanced time series models.

## Steps Performed
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized trends and seasonal decomposition.
   - Analyzed missing data and correlations.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values using forward fill.
   - Normalized numerical features.

3. **Modeling**:
   - Built and evaluated two forecasting models:
     - **ARIMA**
     - **Prophet**
   - Compared the forecasted values with actual values for model evaluation.

## Outputs
1. **Processed Dataset**:
   - The processed dataset (`processed_seattle_weather.csv`) was generated during the preprocessing stage.
   
2. **Models**:
   - Trained models (`arima_seattle_weather_model.pkl` and `prophet_seattle_weather_model.pkl`) were too large to be included in this repository.

## Google Colab Notebook
You can find the complete implementation in the Google Colab notebook:

## Notes
- The processed dataset (`processed_seattle_weather.csv`) is included in this repository.
- Due to size constraints, the models are not uploaded but can be reproduced using the notebook.
