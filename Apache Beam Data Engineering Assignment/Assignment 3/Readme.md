# Apache Beam Features Demonstration

### Overview
This project demonstrates essential features of Apache Beam using a Colab notebook. Each section highlights a unique functionality in Apache Beam, providing a foundation for understanding distributed data processing.

### Colab Notebook
 - [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MG_X3ey8zv9WgxK45_VpN29nnLtdPOwV?usp=sharing)

### Features Demonstrated

1. **Composite Transforms**: Grouping related transforms into reusable operations, making pipelines more modular and readable.
2. **Pipeline I/O**: Writing output data to a file, showing how Apache Beam handles input and output data sources.
3. **Windowing**: Segmenting data into fixed windows (e.g., 2-second intervals) to process grouped elements based on time, which is essential for time-series or streaming data analysis.
4. **ParDo Transformation**: Using `ParDo` with a custom function to apply custom logic to each data element.
5. **Simulated Streaming**: Although true streaming is limited in Colab, a simulated real-time processing pipeline is implemented to demonstrate how Beam can manage data arriving in real-time.

### Notebook Structure
- **Pipeline Setup**: A basic pipeline is set up with Apache Beam.
- **Feature Demonstrations**:
  - Each feature (e.g., Composite Transforms, Windowing) is implemented in a separate section for clarity.
- **Execution**: Each code block can be run sequentially to observe the output and see each feature in action.

### Instructions
1. Open the Colab notebook.
2. Run each cell in order to execute and observe each feature demonstration.
3. Read through the comments and code explanations to understand how each feature operates.

### Key Code Sections
- **Composite Transforms**: Demonstrates modularizing operations with a custom transformation.
- **Windowing Example**: Shows time-based data grouping with fixed windows.
- **ParDo Example**: Custom function application using `ParDo`.
- **Simulated Streaming**: Illustrates how data would be processed in real-time.

### Conclusion
This notebook serves as a practical guide to Apache Beamâ€™s core features, useful for building data processing pipelines in distributed and streaming environments.
