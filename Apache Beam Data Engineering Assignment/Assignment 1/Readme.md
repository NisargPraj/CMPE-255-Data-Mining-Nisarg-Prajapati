# Loan Data Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Overview
This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a loan dataset, with a focus on uncovering key insights and relationships between variables. The project includes both standard data analysis techniques and advanced visualizations created using D3.js.

### What Was Done
1. **Data Loading and Initial Exploration**  
   - Loaded the loan dataset and explored its structure.
   - Identified missing values and handled them for a clean analysis.

2. **Basic Data Analysis**  
   - Performed univariate analysis to understand the distributions of key features (loan amount, interest rate, etc.).
   - Created bar charts for categorical features (loan grade, loan status) to view their distribution.

3. **Bivariate Analysis and Correlation**  
   - Generated a correlation matrix heatmap to find relationships between numerical variables.
   - Used scatter plots to explore pairwise relationships between important features.

4. **Advanced D3.js Visualization**  
   - Created an interactive D3.js parallel coordinates plot to show patterns across multiple variables, making it easy to see how different loan features relate to each other.

### Key Insights
- Higher loan amounts tend to have slightly higher interest rates.
- Loan grade influences interest rate, with higher grades often linked to lower interest rates.
- Borrowers' income and loan grade may impact loan approval likelihood.

### Instructions
- Open the Colab notebook link above.
- Run the cells in sequence to see the data analysis steps and D3.js visualizations.

This project provides a foundation for analyzing loan data and exploring feature relationships through both standard plots and interactive D3.js visuals.
