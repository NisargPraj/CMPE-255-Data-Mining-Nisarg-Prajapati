2. **Correlations**:
   - Highlight any notable correlations between variables, such as time spent on certain apps and overall usage.
3. **Missing Values**:
   - Document any columns with missing data and mention potential next steps (if further cleaning is needed).
4. **Outliers**:
   - Note any outliers or unusual data points that might need investigation.

### Instructions
1. Open the Colab notebook.
2. Run each cell to generate and view the Sweetviz report.
3. Review the report to explore the main behavioral insights.

This Auto EDA provides a foundational understanding of the data, highlighting key trends and identifying areas that may require additional preprocessing or analysis.
