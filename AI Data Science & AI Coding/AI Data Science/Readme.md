# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. The project follows the CRISP-DM methodology, and various machine learning models are compared to find the best-performing one.

## Overview
The main objective of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features like age, gender, passenger class, etc. The workflow includes data exploration, data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using Python and popular machine learning libraries.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, outliers, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Model Training**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM models were trained and compared.
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to evaluate model performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimization of the Random Forest model for better performance.
- **Deployment**: Steps for deploying the trained model to make predictions on new data.
