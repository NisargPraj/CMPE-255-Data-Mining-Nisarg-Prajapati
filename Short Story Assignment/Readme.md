## Abstract

Trajectory computing is a pivotal domain encompassing trajectory data management and mining, garnering widespread
attention due to its crucial role in various practical applications such as location services, urban traffic, and public safety. Traditional
methods, focusing on simplistic spatio-temporal features, face challenges of complex calculations, limited scalability, and inadequate
adaptability to real-world complexities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the development and recent advances in
deep learning for trajectory computing (DL4Traj). We first define trajectory data and provide a brief overview of widely-used deep learning
models. Systematically, we explore deep learning applications in trajectory management (pre-processing, storage, analysis, and
visualization) and mining (trajectory-related forecasting, trajectory-related recommendation, trajectory classification, travel time estimation,
anomaly detection, and mobility generation). Notably, we encapsulate recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that hold
the potential to augment trajectory computing. Additionally, we summarize application scenarios, public datasets, and toolkits. Finally, we
outline current challenges in DL4Traj research and propose future directions.
