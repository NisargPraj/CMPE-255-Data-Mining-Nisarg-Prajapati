# RDL and Relbench

This section demonstrates the use of `RelBench` for graph-based tabular predictions.


### Graph-Based Tabular Prediction
We implemented and trained a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based model for tabular prediction tasks using `RelBench`. The model was evaluated for its performance on various metrics.
