# Explore timegpt, tabula9 and relational deep learning Assignment


This project explores various advanced methodologies and tools to implement data mining tasks. It is structured into three main sections:

1. **TimeGPT**:
   - We explored time-series forecasting, fine-tuning, and anomaly detection using the `TimeGPT` model.
   - Tasks include multivariate forecasting, energy demand prediction, and Bitcoin price prediction.

2. **Tabula**:
   - We generated synthetic data for tabular datasets and demonstrated zero-shot inference using pre-trained models.

3. **RDL and Relbench**:
   - We implemented graph-based models for tabular prediction tasks using `RelBench`.

Each section is accompanied by Google Colab notebooks that detail the code, experiments, and results.
