# Clustering Documents

## Overview
This project demonstrates document clustering using Sentence Transformers (SBERT) embeddings and K-Means clustering on the 20 Newsgroups dataset.

---

## Features
- **State-of-the-Art Embeddings**: Generates embeddings using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model from Sentence Transformers.
- **Clustering**: Uses K-Means clustering to group documents based on semantic similarity.
- **Visualization**: Includes cluster distribution and PCA-based 2D visualization of clusters.

---

## Dataset
The dataset used is the **20 Newsgroups dataset**, a popular text dataset for clustering and classification tasks. A subset of four categories is selected:
- `rec.sport.baseball`
- `sci.space`
- `comp.graphics`
- `talk.politics.guns`
