# Anomaly Detection Using PyOD

## Overview
This project demonstrates anomaly detection using PyOD's Isolation Forest and KNN models on the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset. The models are evaluated based on their ability to detect rare fraudulent transactions in a highly imbalanced dataset.

## Features
- **Anomaly Detection Models**: Implements Isolation Forest and KNN models from PyOD.
- **Visualization**: Displays anomaly scores and highlights detected fraud cases.
- **Evaluation**: Includes classification metrics and ROC-AUC scores.
