# Gaussian Mixture Model Clustering

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for clustering. The implementation includes clustering, visualization of probability densities, and evaluation metrics.

---

## Features
- GMM clustering using `sklearn`.
- Visualization of clusters and probability densities.
- Evaluation using Silhouette Score and BIC.
