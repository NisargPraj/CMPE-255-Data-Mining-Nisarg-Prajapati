# Clustering Time-Series Data

## Overview
This project demonstrates time-series clustering using the Household Electric Power Consumption dataset. Daily power consumption patterns are clustered into groups using the `TimeSeriesKMeans` algorithm, and results are visualized for analysis.

---

## Features
- **Time-Series Clustering**: Implements `TimeSeriesKMeans` to cluster daily consumption patterns.
- **Visualization**: Displays cluster centroids and representative time-series samples.
- **Preprocessing**: Includes resampling, windowing, and normalization of time-series data.

---

## Dataset
The dataset used is the **Household Electric Power Consumption Dataset**, available from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption).
